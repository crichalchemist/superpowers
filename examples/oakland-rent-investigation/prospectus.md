# Why Did My Neighborhood's Rent Spike 40% in Two Years?

**Investigation Goal:** Trace the financial flows behind West Oakland's rapid rent increases from 2020-2022, connecting local displacement to national capital patterns.

**Personal Stake:** I've lived in West Oakland for eight years. In 2020, friends started getting eviction notices. By 2022, half the people I knew had left. I want to understand: was this random, or is there a system at work?

**Thesis:** West Oakland's rent spike wasn't driven by local demand but by out-of-state investors buying buildings en masse, enabled by pandemic-era financing and weak tenant protections.

## Key Actors

**Who Benefits:**
- Real estate investment trusts (REITs) buying Oakland properties
- Delaware-registered LLCs obscuring ownership
- Commercial lenders financing bulk purchases
- Property management companies hired by absentee owners

**Who's Harmed:**
- Long-time Black residents facing displacement
- Low-income families priced out
- Small landlords unable to compete with cash buyers

**Who's Invisible:**
- Tenants who left before formal eviction (no record)
- Informal renters not covered by tenant protections
- Workers commuting longer distances after displacement

## Timeline

**2019:** Pre-pandemic baseline (median rent ~$1,800)
**2020:** Eviction moratorium begins; investor purchases accelerate
**2021:** Delaware LLC acquires 3 buildings on Telegraph Ave
**2021-2022:** Rents increase 37% (Zillow data)
**2022:** Eviction moratorium ends; 412 no-fault evictions filed
**2023:** Median rent ~$2,500; neighborhood demographics shift

## Research Gaps

**Need to find:**
- Ownership records for buildings with highest eviction rates
- Financing sources for bulk property purchases
- Investor prospectuses or marketing materials
- Tenant interviews documenting displacement experiences
- Historical rent data (pre-2019 for context)
- City council records on tenant protection debates

**Unclear:**
- Exact number of displaced families (eviction records undercount)
- Whether investor strategy was opportunistic or coordinated
- Role of city policies (enabling vs. complicit)

## Ethical Considerations

**Potential Harm:**
- Naming individual tenants could enable retaliation
- Detailed eviction stories might re-traumatize
- Focus on displacement could ignore tenant resistance/organizing

**Positionality:**
- I'm a renter, but employed and less vulnerable than those displaced
- Not Black (neighborhood is historically Black); must center their experience, not mine
- Came to Oakland in 2016 (relatively recent); need long-time resident voices

**Missing Voices:**
- Displaced families (many left the area—how to reach them?)
- Small landlords (are they victims or complicit?)
- City officials (have they been consulted by residents?)

**Mitigation:**
- Interview tenant organizers and legal advocates
- Anonymize vulnerable people
- Acknowledge resistance and victories, not just suffering
- Include what residents are doing about it (organizing, policy advocacy)

## Narrative Arc

**Opening (Anecdotal):**
Start with a specific eviction notice—Maria Rodriguez's story (with consent)

**Discovery:**
Property records reveal Delaware LLC; trace to SF-based REIT; find pattern across multiple buildings

**Confrontation:**
Interview REIT spokesperson (or document refusal to comment); review investor marketing materials; contrast with tenant experiences

**Insight:**
This isn't random—it's financialized housing. National capital flowing into local neighborhoods, enabled by policy gaps. But tenant organizing is fighting back.

**Ending:**
What happens next depends on policy (will city strengthen protections?) and organizing (can tenants build power?). No false resolution—the fight continues.
