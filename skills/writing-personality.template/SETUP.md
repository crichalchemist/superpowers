# Writing Personality Setup

**Note:** Use `skills/example-personality/` as your template (it's tracked in git as a reference).

To give the Narrator agent context about your authentic writing voice:

1. Copy the example:
   ```bash
   cp -r skills/example-personality skills/writing-personality
   ```

2. Edit the files to reflect YOUR voice:
   - `style-analysis.md` - Your voice traits, patterns, signatures
   - `voice-checklist.md` - Checks you use when editing

3. The `skills/writing-personality/` directory is gitignored - your voice files stay private.

See `skills/example-personality/README.md` for full documentation.
