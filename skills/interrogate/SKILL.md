# Interrogating Ideas Into Story Prospectuses

## Overview

Help turn observations, hunches, and questions into fully formed story prospectuses through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding what the writer has observed or is curious about, then ask questions one at a time to sharpen the investigative angle. Once you understand the story, present the prospectus in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it captures the investigation correctly.

## The Process

**Understanding the observation:**
- What did you notice? What changed? What doesn't make sense?
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the investigative angle
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on: personal stake, systemic patterns, who benefits/suffers, what's hidden

**Example questions:**
- "Is this a recent change or part of a longer pattern?"
- "Who would have the power to influence this? (a) Local government (b) Private companies (c) Federal policy (d) Multiple forces"
- "What would you need to know to understand WHY this is happening?"

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different narrative frames with trade-offs:
  - Personal essay (intimate, limited scope, accessible)
  - Investigative feature (rigorous, broad, requires extensive sourcing)
  - Hybrid narrative investigation (personal entry point, systemic analysis)
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended approach and explain why

**Presenting the story prospectus:**
- Once you understand the investigation, present the prospectus
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it captures the story correctly
- Cover:
  - **Thesis**: What are you arguing or revealing?
  - **Personal stake**: Why you, why now?
  - **Key actors**: Who benefits? Who's harmed? Who's invisible?
  - **Timeline**: Critical moments and turning points
  - **Research gaps**: What you need to find out
  - **Ethical considerations**: Potential harm, positionality, responsibility
  - **Narrative arc**: How the story unfolds (question → discovery → confrontation → insight)
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't resonate

## After the Prospectus

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated prospectus to `writing/prospectuses/YYYY-MM-DD-<story-slug>.md`
- Commit the prospectus to git (or save with timestamp if not using git)

**Research Planning (if continuing):**
- Ask: "Ready to plan the research and drafting process?"
- Use narrative:story-plan to create detailed research and writing plan
- Consider which specialist agents to invoke: Archivist, Analyst, Ethicist, Narrator, Skeptic, Community Listener

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **Personal → Structural** - Start with lived experience, zoom out to systems
- **Ethics first** - Always consider who might be harmed
- **Sources before claims** - Identify research gaps explicitly
- **Writer as investigator** - Not omniscient narrator, but curious witness
