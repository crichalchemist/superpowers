# Voice Checklist

Use this before publishing to ensure the draft sounds like **you**.

## Rhythm Check

- [ ] Does it have my cadence when read aloud?
- [ ] Are sentence lengths varied intentionally?
- [ ] Do paragraph breaks create breathing room?
- [ ] Could anyone else have written this exact way?

## Structural Trace

- [ ] Does it follow my argument scaffolds?
- [ ] Are my typical moves present? (map-then-complicate, reframe, zoom in/out)
- [ ] Is complexity introduced at my pace?

## Punctuation Ethics

- [ ] Are commas, dashes, semicolons used my way?
- [ ] Does punctuation create the pauses I intend?
- [ ] Are there any "foreign" punctuation choices?

## Reader Hook

- [ ] Would this pull in someone unfamiliar with the topic?
- [ ] Are the first 2-3 sentences immediately engaging?
- [ ] Is there a clear "why this matters" early?

## Emotional Residue

- [ ] What feeling lingers after reading?
- [ ] Is it the feeling I want to leave?
- [ ] Does it balance rigor with humanity?

## Voice Authenticity

- [ ] Would I say this in conversation (adjusted for formality)?
- [ ] Are there phrases that don't sound like me?
- [ ] Is the level of certainty/uncertainty true to how I think?
