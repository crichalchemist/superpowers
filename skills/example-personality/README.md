# Writing Personality Template

**Location:** Copy this template to `skills/writing-personality/` (excluded from git)

This directory preserves your writing voice, style evolution, and authorial identity for the Narrator agent to reference during investigative/creative nonfiction drafting.

## Purpose

When the Narrator agent reviews your drafts, it needs to understand:
- Your authentic voice characteristics
- Your stylistic signatures and techniques
- Your intellectual/rhetorical patterns
- How your voice has evolved and where it's heading

This ensures AI-assisted drafting sounds like **you**, not generic journalism.

## Structure

### `style-analysis.md` (Recommended)
Deep audit of your voice characteristics:
- Core traits (e.g., direct, rhythmic, lyrical, analytical)
- Intellectual moves (e.g., naming patterns, reframing techniques)
- Stylistic signatures (e.g., punctuation patterns, sentence rhythms)
- Evolution trajectory (how your voice has changed over time)

### `voice-checklist.md` (Recommended)
Pre-publication voice integrity scan:
- Rhythm check (does it have your cadence?)
- Structural patterns (your argument scaffolds)
- Punctuation ethics (how you use commas, dashes, semicolons)
- Reader hooks (how you bring people into complexity)
- Emotional residue (what feeling lingers?)

### `signature-techniques.md` (Optional)
Quick-reference guide to moves that work for you:
- Syntax patterns (e.g., three-beat clauses, nested structures)
- Argument scaffolds (e.g., map-then-complicate, reframe, subvert)
- Lexicon strategies (e.g., elevated plainspeak, metaphor use)
- Known phrases (your recurring constructions)

### `style-evolution.md` (Optional)
Your current voice phase:
- What you're moving toward (new techniques, tonal shifts)
- What you're moving away from (patterns to retire)
- Intentional experiments (voice risks you're taking)

### `voice-evolution.md` (Optional)
Historical development:
- Early voice (where you started)
- Major shifts (catalysts for change)
- Consistent threads (what's remained stable)

## Getting Started

1. **Copy this template:**
   ```bash
   cp -r skills/writing-personality.template skills/writing-personality
   ```

2. **Start with style-analysis.md:**
   - Read 3-5 pieces you're proud of
   - Note recurring patterns (syntax, vocabulary, rhetorical moves)
   - Document what makes your voice distinct

3. **Build voice-checklist.md incrementally:**
   - Add checks as you notice patterns
   - Refine based on what you actually use during edits

4. **Expand as needed:**
   - Add files only if they serve your drafting process
   - This is personal scaffolding, not performance

## How the Narrator Agent Uses This

When the Narrator reviews your drafts:
1. Reads your voice reference materials first
2. Evaluates draft against your authentic patterns
3. Suggests edits that strengthen (not dilute) your voice
4. Flags moments where the draft doesn't "sound like you"

## Privacy Note

`skills/writing-personality/` is in `.gitignore` - your voice files stay local and private.

## Example: Minimal Setup

If you just want the basics:

**skills/writing-personality/style-analysis.md:**
```markdown
# My Writing Voice

## Core Traits
- Conversational but precise
- Uses concrete examples before abstractions
- Comfortable with uncertainty/nuance

## Syntax Patterns
- Short sentences for emphasis
- Longer, clause-heavy sentences for exploration
- Questions to open sections

## Lexicon
- Plain language over jargon
- Metaphors from everyday life (cooking, walking, weather)
- Comfortable with "I" and personal stake
```

That's enough to start. Expand as you notice more patterns.
