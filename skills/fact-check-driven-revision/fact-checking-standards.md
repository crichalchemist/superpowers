# Fact-Checking Standards for Investigative Writing

## Source Hierarchy

**Primary sources** (highest confidence):
- Government records, court documents, official databases
- Original research studies, datasets
- Direct interviews, eyewitness accounts
- Archival documents, historical records

**Secondary sources** (medium confidence):
- News reporting from reputable outlets (verify against primary when possible)
- Academic summaries, meta-analyses
- Expert analysis, white papers

**Tertiary sources** (lowest confidence):
- Wikipedia, blogs, social media (use only as leads, verify independently)
- Advocacy organization claims (check against neutral sources)

## Citation Format

**Inline citations with footnotes:**

```markdown
The policy change affected an estimated 12,000 residents^[City Planning Dept., "Housing Impact Report 2023," p. 47, accessed via public records request 2024-01-10].
```

**Quote attribution:**

```markdown
"We had no choice but to leave," said Maria Rodriguez, a tenant organizer with the West Oakland Housing Coalition^[Phone interview, 2024-01-12].
```

**Data with methodology:**

```markdown
Median household income in the neighborhood increased 18% in inflation-adjusted dollars between 2015 and 2020^[U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5-year estimates, Table B19013, accessed 2024-01-15 via data.census.gov].
```

## Uncertainty Language

Use when evidence is limited but suggestive:

- **"Appears"**: One strong source or multiple weak sources
- **"Suggests"**: Pattern in data but alternative explanations exist
- **"May" / "Might"**: Plausible but not confirmed
- **"According to"**: Emphasizes this is one source's claim, not verified fact
- **"Reportedly"**: Secondhand information not independently confirmed

## Common Pitfalls

**1. Correlation ≠ Causation**
❌ "The tech boom caused homelessness to spike."
✓ "Homelessness increased 45% during the tech boom (2012-2018), though researchers debate whether this is causal or coincidental."

**2. Misleading Statistics**
❌ "Crime increased 300%!" (from 2 incidents to 8)
✓ "Reported thefts increased from 2 to 8 incidents in the past year—a small sample but a notable trend in a previously low-crime area."

**3. Quote Mining**
❌ Taking "We support housing" from "We support housing, but this proposal is deeply flawed."
✓ Include full context or note "...though he criticized the specific proposal."

**4. Generalizing from Anecdotes**
❌ "Everyone I talked to said..." (interviewed 3 people)
✓ "The five tenants I interviewed all reported..." (acknowledge sample size)

**5. Outdated Data**
❌ Using 2015 census data in 2024 without noting age
✓ "According to 2015 census data (the most recent available for this metric)..."

## Verification Checklist

Before publishing any claim:

- [ ] Is this a fact or an opinion/interpretation?
- [ ] Do I have a primary source, or am I relying on reporting?
- [ ] If it's a statistic, do I know how it was calculated?
- [ ] If it's a quote, is it exact and in context?
- [ ] If it's a causal claim, is there research supporting causation?
- [ ] Have I checked for counterevidence or alternative explanations?
- [ ] Is the source recent enough to be relevant?
- [ ] Would I stake my credibility on this claim?

When in doubt: qualify, cite, or flag for more research.
